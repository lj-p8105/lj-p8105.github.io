### *Currently*

I am a M.S. student studying biostatistics at Mailman. My interest is mainly in statistical decision theory and optimization with applications in health policy, economics, and population health.

### *Autobiography*

I was born and raised in Guangzhou in China and I came to the U.S. for college. I studied mathematics, biology, and political science at UT Austin. Having grown up in a family of healthcare professionals, I have always wanted to build my own career in aim of improving population health.

### *Hobbies*

I love reading, old movies, exercising. I used to play an instrument but am now very rusty at it. I'd love to be better at bridge or poker if I could.
